        <p>
            I joined icddr,b as a Project Research Physician on January 6, 2019, under the Child Health and Mortality
            Prevention Surveillance <a href="https://champshealth.org/" target="_blank" class="linkDecExt">(CHAMPS)</a>

                (International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh) is one of the most
                prestigious public health research institutions in Bangladesh and globally. From a young age, I have
                been an
                curious individual, driven by a passion for thinking, creating, and innovating like a scientist. When I
                got
                the opportunity to study medicine in Bangladesh, I initially felt uncertain about how it aligned with my
                aspirations. However, I decided to embrace the challenge and use my medical knowledge to contribute to
                scientific research in the field of public health.

        Joining icddr,b was a dream come true for me, as it is for many aspiring researchers in Bangladesh. Known as
        a hub for world-renowned public health scientists, icddr,b offers an unparalleled learning environment for
        those passionate about advancing public health research. For anyone in Bangladesh aspiring to become a
        public health scientist, icddr,b is the ultimate school of learning and discoveryâ€”and it was no different
        for me.

            <h4>Roles and Activities</h4>
            <h5 class="yellowBg"><i class="fa-solid fa-person-chalkboard"></i> Training and Capacity Building</h5> <br>
            <p> I have contributed extensively to training and capacity-building initiatives within my role. Below are
                some
                of the key activities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>MITS Trainer</b><br>
                    I serve as a trainer for Minimally Invasive Tissue Sampling (MITS) for newly appointed physicians at
                    CHAMPS Bangladesh. To date, I have trained 14 physicians in MITS techniques. Additionally, I provide
                    field support to other physicians, including arranging and conducting training sessions for NIPAH
                    virus study physicians on MITS procedures. I am also responsible for organizing refresher training
                    sessions for CHAMPS MITS physicians to ensure they remain up-to-date with best practices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>IPC Training at ZMCH</b><br>
                    In response to findings from our work, I played a role to organize Infection Prevention and Control
                    (IPC) training
                    at ZMCH and our training resulted in an introduction of individual suction tubes for all neonates in
                    the SCANU (Special Care Newborn
                    Unit), aiming to reduce cross-contamination and improve neonatal care.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Research Methodology Training</b> <br>
                    I facilitated a Research Methodology Training program, conducted by icddr,b, for the faculty of
                    BSMMC to strengthen their research capabilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Training on Consent Taking</b> <br>
                    As the MITS team supervisor, I am responsible for training physicians on obtaining informed consent
                    from the parents of deceased children while maintaining ethical standards and sensitivity.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="yellowBg"><i class="fa-solid fa-magnifying-glass-plus"></i> Research Activities</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Environmental Sampling at BSMMCH and ZMCH</b> <br>
                    <span class="caption">September 19, 2022</span> <br>
                    In our mortality surveillance efforts at BSMMCH and ZMCH, we identified that neonatal sepsis
                    accounted for a significant proportion of deaths. Many of the causative organisms were
                    facility-specific and showed high resistance to commonly used antibiotics. To address this, I worked
                    with the laboratory team to
                    conducted environmental sampling at these facilities to pinpoint the sources of these organisms and
                    understand their transmission dynamics.
