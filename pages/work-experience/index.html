            I joined icddr,b as a Project Research Physician on January 6, 2019, under the Child Health and Mortality
            Prevention Surveillance <a href="https://champshealth.org/" target="_blank" class="linkDecExt">(CHAMPS)</a>

                (International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh) is one of the most
                prestigious public health research institutions in Bangladesh and globally. From a young age, I have
                been an
                curious individual, driven by a passion for thinking, creating, and innovating like a scientist. When I
                got
                the opportunity to study medicine in Bangladesh, I initially felt uncertain about how it aligned with my
                aspirations. However, I decided to embrace the challenge and use my medical knowledge to contribute to
                scientific research in the field of public health.

        Joining icddr,b was a dream come true for me, as it is for many aspiring researchers in Bangladesh. Known as
        a hub for world-renowned public health scientists, icddr,b offers an unparalleled learning environment for
        those passionate about advancing public health research. For anyone in Bangladesh aspiring to become a
        public health scientist, icddr,b is the ultimate school of learning and discoveryâ€”and it was no different
        for me.

                    <p>
                        Since 2019, I have been working on the 
                        <a href="https://champshealth.org/" target="_blank" class="linkDecExt">Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS)</a>. 
                        CHAMPS is a global surveillance network that generates and shares accurate information on causes of stillbirths and child deaths in 
                        high-mortality settings in Africa and South Asia.</p>
                    <p>
                        Working closely with communities and their leaders, CHAMPS teams work quickly to identify deaths and with a family's consent, uses innovative 
                        diagnostic methods including 
                        Minimally Invasive Tissue Sampling (MITS)<a href="#ref1" class="linkDec"><sup>1</sup></a>
                        to investigate the causes.</p>
                        <p>
                        The network operates in 22 catchment areas across 9 countries, providing trusted, evidence-based data on child mortality to 
                        inform policy, public health practice, and health system changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Bangladesh site, where I am working, operates in the Baliakandi sub-district of Rajbari district, a region with a high child 
                        mortality rate. CHAMPS Bangladesh covers a population of over 216,000 people under surveillance and works with key facilities 
                        including the Baliakandi Upazila Health Complex (BUHC), Faridpur Medical College Hospital (FMCH), and Zahid Memorial Children 
                        Hospital (ZMCH). The site is implemented through collaboration between 
                        <a href="https://www.icddrb.org/" target="_blank" class="linkDecExt">icddr,b</a>, 
                        <a href="https://www.iedcr.gov.bd/" target="_blank" class="linkDecExt">IEDCR</a>, and 
                        <a href="https://www.bsmmu.edu.bd/" target="_blank" class="linkDecExt">BSMMU</a>, representing Bangladesh as the initial selection 
                        from South East Asia in the CHAMPS network.

                                        our mission goes beyond numbers. For 10 years, CHAMPS has gone beyond documenting child deaths to uncovering their true causes through 
                                        scientific investigation.

                                        Our work informs policies, empowers communities, and shapes interventions that prevent future loss of young lives. The evidence we generate 
                                        highlights the urgent need for stronger health systems and targeted responses. When science, policy, and action come together, lives are saved.

                of neonatal mortalities, such as sepsis. We conduct regular hospital environmental sampling to pinpoint the sources and understand the transmission dynamics
                of pathogens that may cause nosocomial infections. One of our research initiatives led to

                Another finding, highlighting the lack 
                of adequate clinical information, led to the introduction of a <a href="/pages/innovation/ims-2024/" class="linkDec">structured clinical form</a> at FMCH.</p>
