        <h3>Roster Manager for the Intern Doctors</h3>
        <hr>
        <div>
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
                In 2019, I developed a roster management system to streamline the yearly scheduling of intern doctors at Faridpur Medical College Hospital, 
                Bangladesh. While not a traditional software application, this Excel-based solution used advanced formulas and macros to manage the highly 
                complex process of assigning interns across multiple departments for their mandatory rotations.
            </p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">
                    <h4>Motivation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Every year, hundreds of newly graduated MBBS students must complete structured rotations across different hospital departments. Traditionally, 
                        this was planned manually by department heads and the intern coordinator. But, this is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Departments 
                        like cardiology, nephrology, pediatrics, and orthopedics require a consistent number of interns to ensure patient care, while interns themselves 
                        must complete specific rotations without duplication. Without careful year-ahead planning, the hospital often faced mid-term staffing crises, 
                        with some departments left under-resourced.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Key features</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Automated generation of a complete year-long roster for all intern doctors</li>
                        <li>Individual access for interns to view their personal rotation schedules</li>
                        <li>Department-level views for professors, showing incoming interns and their assigned timelines</li>
                        <li>Built-in rules to prevent duplication of rotations for interns</li>
                        <li>Constraints to maintain minimum staffing levels across all departments</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-12">

            </div>
            <h4>Impact</h4>
            <p>
                The roster manager was successfully implemented during the 2019-2020 academic year. It eliminated mid-year staffing shortages, provided 
                clarity for both interns and department heads, and significantly reduced the administrative burden.
