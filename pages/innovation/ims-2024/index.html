        <h3>Inauguration of Inpatient Management System</h3>
        <p style="font-weight: 200;">01 January, 2024</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>In Bangladesh, inpatient management in most government hospitals is still conducted through paper-based
            systems, with no real-time electronic recording or management. To advance healthcare, it is essential to
            introduce modern technologies in patient care and management. The absence of an electronic patient record
            system often forces doctors to rely on patients' verbal accounts of their illness histories. This approach
            can be significantly improved with a centralized patient record system, enabling physicians to make more
            informed decisions—something that is already standard practice in many developed countries.
            <br>
            Introducing such changes to the government healthcare system is challenging. Without background studies on
            implementation challenges, effective planning and scaling become
            difficult. However, in Bangladesh, there is also a lack of
            research on the actual costs, planning, and resources required to implement such transformations nationwide,
            particularly in a system that is inherently resilient to change.
            <br>
            Moreover,
        </p>
        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <p>
            To address this gap, the Head of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Faridpur Medical
            College Hospital, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fSJduvQAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank"
                class="linkDecExt">Professor Dr. Dilruba Zeba</a> embarked on a mission to implement a software-based
            inpatient management system within
            her department. Her objectives were
        <ul>
            <li>to replace all paper-based tasks with a computer-based system in a scientific and research-oriented way,
            </li>
            <li>to introduce a platform for recording all patient data from admission to discharge,</li>
            <li>to enable electronic creation of prescriptions, consent forms, and pre- and postoperative orders,</li>
            <li>to digitally store investigation reports that are not typically included in patient files at the
                hospital, and</li>
            <li>to assign a unique ID to each patient, ensuring that their previous hospital records are easily
                accessible if they return.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Also, the wanted to launch the system from January 1st in 2024.</p>
        </p>
        <h4>Method (Where I Enter the Scenario)</h4>
        <p>In the second week of November 2023, Professor Dr. Dilruba Zeba approached me to ask if there was any
            platform that met her objectives. Later, she requested that I build a customized system so we could have the
            full flexibility to modify, adapt, and improve it, thereby avoiding additional barriers that might delay its
            implementation.
            <br>
            Building such a system within two weeks was challenging. However, as I already had a software solution with
            similar capabilities, I offered to help. Using my existing scientific prescription-writing software,
            <a href="https://scirx.markcite.com/" target="_blank" class="linkDecExt">SciRx</a>,
            as a foundation, I adapted it to meet the hospital's specific needs.
        <div class="quote">
            The task turned out to be more difficult than I had anticipated. I had to redesign the user interface,
            update the database to capture comprehensive patient records, revise the logic for login roles and security,
            create print layouts for various scenarios, test the system, fix bugs, and much more.</div>
        Despite the challenges, after several days and sleepless nights, I successfully deployed the software four
        days ahead of schedule. I used the remaining four days to train the end users—doctors in the Department of
        Obstetrics and Gynecology—and fine-tune the software to ensure it met their needs effectively.

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
            The project came to an end due to some operational difficulties but we had several learnings from this
            implementation. Details of the learnings will be discussed further in another case study.
