        <h3>Leadership Experience</h3>
        <hr>
        <div>
            Throughout my career, I have demonstrated strong leadership abilities, particularly in the areas of public
            health research, capacity building, and implementing innovative solutions. My work has consistently involved
            bringing together diverse teams, fostering collaboration, and driving impactful results.
            <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">Implementing Modern Systems in Healthcare</h4>
            As a leader in implementing a software-based inpatient management system at Faridpur Medical College
            Hospital, I played a pivotal role in transforming the department's workflow. This project required not only
            technical expertise but also the ability to motivate and train end-users, including senior physicians and
            department heads. Overcoming challenges such as tight timelines and resistance to change, I ensured
            successful deployment and adoption of the system.

            <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">Training and Mentorship</h4>
            As a MITS trainer, I have taken on the responsibility of training and mentoring newly appointed physicians,
            equipping them with the skills needed to conduct complex procedures. My approach ensures that team members
            not only learn technical competencies but also develop an understanding of ethical practices, such as
            obtaining consent. Additionally, I have facilitated high-impact training sessions, including Research
            Methodology and IPC training, which have strengthened the capacity of healthcare professionals across
            institutions.

            <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">Driving Research and Field Activities</h4>
            My leadership extends to field-based research initiatives, such as mortality surveillance and environmental
            sampling at healthcare facilities. I led efforts to identify facility-specific sources of neonatal sepsis
            and worked with teams to implement solutions like introducing individual suction tubes in neonatal care. My
            ability to translate research findings into actionable interventions has had a measurable impact on
            improving health outcomes.

            <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">Team Building and Strategic Collaboration</h4>
            Working with multidisciplinary teams at icddr,b and CHAMPS, I have built strong professional networks and
            collaborated with international researchers, academics, and policymakers. My leadership style emphasizes
            clear communication, shared goals, and a focus on outcomes, ensuring that projects move forward efficiently
            and effectively.

            <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">Inspiring Vision and Adaptability</h4>
            My journey from a medical graduate to a public health researcher and software developer reflects my
            visionary leadership and adaptability. Whether designing AI models to predict pregnancy complications or
            crafting manuscripts for journal publications, I approach challenges with curiosity, determination, and a
            commitment to excellence, inspiring those around me to strive for the same.
