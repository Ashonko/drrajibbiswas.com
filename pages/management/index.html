        <h3>Management Skills</h3>
        <hr>
        <div>
            Over the course of my career, I have honed strong management skills that have allowed me to oversee diverse
            projects, coordinate teams, and implement impactful initiatives in public health, research, and healthcare
            systems. My management style is rooted in strategic planning, adaptability, and effective communication,
            enabling me to deliver results even in challenging environments.

            <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">Project Management</h4>
            At CHAMPS Bangladesh, I have managed multiple research projects, from study design to execution. These
            projects required meticulous
            planning, task
            prioritization, and the ability to adapt to unforeseen challenges, ensuring objectives were met on time and
            within resource constraints. <br>
            While deploying a software-based inpatient management system at Faridpur Medical College Hospital, I managed
            all aspects of the project, including stakeholder engagement, system development, user training, and
            troubleshooting. This required balancing technical demands with user needs and delivering the project ahead
            of schedule.

            <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">Team Coordination and Leadership</h4>
            I have led multidisciplinary teams, including physicians, consent takers, medical technologists, and
            technical staff, fostering
            collaboration and ensuring that all team members were aligned with project goals. My ability to delegate
            effectively, provide guidance, and motivate my team has been instrumental in achieving project success.
            As a MITS team supervisor, I coordinate the efforts of physicians conducting minimally invasive tissue
            sampling, ensuring compliance with protocols and high-quality data collection.

            <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">Training and Capacity Building</h4>
            I have successfully organized and facilitated training programs for healthcare professionals, including
            Research Methodology workshops, IPC training, and consent-taking sessions. My ability to manage training
            logistics, prepare materials, and adapt content to the audience's needs has made these programs highly
            impactful.


            <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">Resource Management</h4>
            I have efficiently managed resources, whether it be optimizing research budgets, ensuring the availability
            of essential supplies, or streamlining workflows in hospital settings.

            <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">Stakeholder Engagement</h4>
            My work often involves engaging with diverse stakeholders, from senior physicians and department heads to
            international collaborators. I excel in building relationships, aligning interests, and ensuring transparent
            communication, which has been critical in driving initiatives forward.

            <h4 style="padding-top: 20px;">Problem-Solving and Decision-Making</h4>
            In dynamic and often high-pressure environments, I have demonstrated strong problem-solving skills. Whether
            revising a software interface to meet end-user needs or addressing challenges in field-based research, I
            approach problems analytically and take decisive actions to ensure outcomes are achieved.
            
            <h3 style="padding-top: 60px;">Additional Management Tasks</h3>
            <hr>
            Over the years, I have also taken on additional management responsibilities, including:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Election Officer</b> for the CHAMPS Faridpur Field Office in the icddr,b Staff Welfare 
                    Association (SWA) Election for the 2024â€“2026 term. <a href="docs/Memo_Schedule_of_Field_Sites_Vote_LH.pdf" class="linkDec">See the Memo</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p style="padding-top: 40px;">
                I emphasize the importance of monitoring and evaluating the impact of initiatives. Through these
                experiences, I have developed a
                versatile and impactful management skill set that enables
                me
                to lead complex projects and teams while ensuring the delivery of meaningful outcomes in public health
                and
                healthcare research.
