        <h3>Teaching Experience</h3>
        <hr>
        <div>
            Teaching has been a significant part of my career, where I have combined my passion for learning and sharing
            knowledge to empower others in healthcare and research. My teaching experience spans various settings, from
            formal training programs to one-on-one mentorship, focusing on equipping healthcare professionals and
            researchers with essential skills and knowledge.

            <h4 class="pt20">Training Physicians in Minimally Invasive Tissue Sampling (MITS)</h4>
            As a MITS trainer for CHAMPS Bangladesh, I have trained newly appointed physicians in a complex and
            innovative procedure critical for mortality surveillance. My role involves not just technical teaching but
            also instilling ethical practices, such as obtaining informed consent. This requires effective
            communication, sensitivity, and the ability to adapt teaching methods to individual learning styles.

            <h4 class="pt20">Workshops on Research Methodology</h4>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-lg-8 col-sm-12">
                    I have organized and facilitated Research Methodology workshops for faculty members at Faridpur Medical
            College,
            ensuring they gain a deeper understanding of research design, data analysis, and
            manuscript preparation. These workshops have strengthened the research capacity of participants, enabling
            them to conduct and publish high-quality studies.

                        class="img-fluid" style="width: 100%;"
                        alt="Rajib Biswas conducting session on research methodology at FMCH">

                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h4 class="pt20">Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Training</h4>
            Recognizing the need for enhanced neonatal care, I organized and facilitated IPC training at ZMCH, focusing
            on
            practical interventions like the use of individual suction tubes for neonates. This hands-on training
            improved the participants' ability to implement effective infection control measures, reducing neonatal
            sepsis risks.

            <h4 class="pt20">End-User Training for Software Implementation</h4>
            While deploying a software-based inpatient management system at Faridpur Medical College Hospital, I
            provided comprehensive training to physicians and staff, ensuring smooth adoption of the system. This
            required simplifying complex technical processes, creating user-friendly guides, and offering continued
            support to build confidence among users.

            <h4 class="pt20">Mentorship in Research and Data Analysis</h4>
            I have mentored junior researchers and colleagues in designing studies, conducting data analysis, and
            preparing manuscripts for publication. My mentorship is rooted in practical examples and clear guidance,
            fostering a deeper understanding of research processes among my mentees.

            <h4 class="pt20">Training on Consent Taking</h4>
            As part of my responsibilities in the MITS program, I have trained physicians on the nuances of obtaining
            consent from grieving families with empathy and adherence to ethical standards. This training not only
            improves the consent-taking process but also prepares physicians to handle sensitive situations with
            professionalism.

            <p class="pt40">My teaching philosophy emphasizes clarity, engagement, and fostering a
                supportive environment where learners
                feel empowered to apply their knowledge effectively. By tailoring my approach to meet the needs of
                diverse
                audiences, I aim to inspire others to achieve their potential and contribute meaningfully to public
                health
                and research.</p>
